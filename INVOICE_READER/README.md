INVOICE READER

A program that reads invoices as pdf and extracts the information in text format.
The text is then scanned to fetch the invoice details. The information collected from 
multiple invoices is then stored into a csv file.

Fields like Bill No, PNR, Name, Sector, Amount, Tax and others are scanned.

* This program works for invoices of a particular format(invoice for a particular company).
